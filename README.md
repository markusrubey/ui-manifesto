# UI Manifesto

Normally designs are delivered as frozen versions of an interactive app. This document tries to outline some of the gaps in a static design file in Zeplin and specs out what is the baseline for a great app.

In each section there is a _Do_ and _Do not_ list to highlight some of the things to be aware of and what to avoid doing.

## Loading

### Loading in general

When the app is waiting on the API

| Do                                                                                        | Do not                                                                                | 
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Disable buttons that can interfere with an ongoing action | Avoid blocking navigation when loading, the user should be able to "cancel" actions in case of timeouts or similar |
| Always provide button states, so the user is aware that buttons are disabled |  |

### Form loading

When the app takes input and sends input to API such as a login or settings screen.

| Do                                                                                        | Do not                                                                                | 
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Disable all input fields or hide them while waiting for a response | Overlay the input fields with a loader |
| Disable buttons while loading so only one request is sent  | Overlay the input fields with a loader |
| Hide the keyboard | |


### Searching

When the app takes search strings and maybe provides autocomplete

| Do                                                                                        | Do not                                                                                | 
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Limit searches to at least 2 characters or more | Start searching immediately |
| Debounce/throttle searches to once every 2 seconds or so, this will easy the API load, but also simplify client state | Send a request for every character written |
| Cancel any outbound request when starting a new search, so we avoid response A being received after response B  | Overlay the input fields with a loader |
| Show a loader whenever a request is in flight, so the user is aware of incoming results | Only show results without a loader, the user will potentially misclick when the results switches |

### Pull to refresh

When a list is reloading content. **We should always implement pull to refresh in lists with changing data.**

| Do                                                                                        | Do not                                                                                | 
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Use platform standards so the behaviour is familiar to the user | Implement an additional blocking loader if pull to refresh is available. Programmatically show the pull to refresh loader if manual refresh is being done |
| Merge/diff results so the list is partly updated or even animated with changes |  |


## Empty state/views

## Error handling

### No connection

When the app does not have an internet connection.

| Do                                                                                        | Do not                                                                                | 
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A non-invasive error message, toast, or snack bar. (“No connection”)                      | Block the UI with an error overlay                                                    |
| If it blocks what the user is doing, show a dialog with an explanation                    | Clear existing data                                                                   |
|                                                                                           | Present a blank view                                                                  |
|                                                                                           | Present an empty state view                                                           |
